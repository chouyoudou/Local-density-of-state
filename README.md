## Principle
Divide the unit cell into (%custom) thick slices parallel to the interface, and specify each slice as a local ( $\mu \mathrm{th})$ region $\Omega_\mu$, and then define a local density of states $D_\mu(\epsilon)$ of the $\mu$ th region as

$$
\begin{gathered}
D_\mu(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\frac{1}{V_{B Z}} \sum_\nu \int \omega_{\boldsymbol{k} \nu}^\mu \delta\left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}{\boldsymbol{k} \nu}\right) d \boldsymbol{k}, \\
\omega{\boldsymbol{k} \nu}^\mu=\int_{\Omega_\mu} \rho_{\boldsymbol{k} \nu}(\boldsymbol{r}) d \boldsymbol{r},
\end{gathered}
$$


where $\boldsymbol{k}$ denotes a point in the Brillouin zone, $\nu$ is a band index, $V_{B Z}$ is the volume of the Brillouin zone, and $\rho_{k \nu}(r)$ is a partial electron density contributed from an eigenwave function labeled by $\boldsymbol{k}$ and $\nu$.

| band_min | int     |         | Specify the minimum value of the range of band numbers, same as k_min. |
| band_max | int     |         | Same as band_min. |
| eigenval_path | str     |         | The path of EIGENVAL, which is generated by VASP. |
